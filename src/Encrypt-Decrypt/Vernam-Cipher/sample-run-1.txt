Welcome to Vernam's Ciphers!
Here, you can encrypt and decrypt text using a Vernam Cipher!
In order to use the Vernam Cipher, you must first have a key to encrypt or decrypt text. It is recommended to use a key only for one encryption and one decryption.
You can also create keys that will be saved as files on the computer and delete keys from the computer on Vernam's Ciphers.

Would you like to encrypt text, decrypt text, generate keys, or delete keys (e/dcrpt/g/del) ? g
NOTE: Key(s) will be generated and entered into files. Each keys will have its own text file and all the these files will be stored in a folder.
Enter the name of the folder the key(s) will be stored in: keys
Sorry, this folder already exists.
Enter the name of the folder the key(s) will be stored in: keys
Enter how many keys you would like to generate: 3
Enter the number of characters in each key: 128
Keys generated
Would you like to email your keys (y/n) (NOTE: Can only use the Gmail provider, which requires an App Password) ? n

Would you like to encrypt text, decrypt text, generate keys, or delete keys (e/dcrpt/g/del) ? e
Enter the full name of the key file you would like to use to encrypt your plaintext (e.g. ./tmp/keys/key1.txt): keys/key1.txt
If the key file is in the default foler (e.g. ./tmp/keys/key1.txt), then hit enter. Else enter the folder name here.
Enter the text you would like to encrypt (NOTE: Can only be 128 character(s) long) : DenverColorado
ENCRYPTED TEXT: 'jT2RVEz8JLbn!

Would you like to send the encryption/decryption (NOTE: Can only send using the Gmail provider. You must have an App Password to do so.) (y/n)? n
